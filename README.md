# ETH Quantum Hackathon 2024

## NVIDIA Challenge:
### Distributed Quantum Computing and the Vehicle Routing Problem

this repo is the result of the ETH quantum hackathon of 2024. we choose the challenge suggest by nvidia. see Emailing ETH_QEC_HACKATHON_NVIDIA_CHALLENGE_v1.pdf for the problem statement

ocean_cleaning.ipynb is where the main pipeline is. it uses the utils files and the content of clustering.ipynb files.

utils/graph.py and utils/tsp.py are used to generate graph data and solve TSP classically

clustering.ipynb is where we implemented the clustering and clustering_optimization.py is the cluster enhancement part
